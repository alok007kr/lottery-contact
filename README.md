Lottery Contract created using the solidity and ethereum.


I created a lottery contract using the solidity. In this application, the user can enter itself to the game,
when they pay some amount of ether and than the lottery game starts and when the  manager will execute the pickWinner() function the winner will declared 
And all the amount of ether paid by the users who were playing will be transferred to the winner account.
